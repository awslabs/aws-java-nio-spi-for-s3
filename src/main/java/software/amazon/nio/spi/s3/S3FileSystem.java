     * of name elements (see {@link Path}) and is joined to form a path string.
     * The details as to how the Strings are joined is provider specific, but
     * typically they will be joined using the {@link #getSeparator
     * name-separator} as the separator. For example, if the name separator is
     * "{@code /}" and {@code getPath("/foo","bar","gus")} is invoked, then the

     * choose to reject path strings that contain names that are longer than those
     * allowed by any file store, and where an implementation supports a complex
     * path syntax, it may choose to reject path strings that are <em>badly
     * formed</em>.
     *
     * <p> In the case of the default provider, path strings are parsed based
     * on the definition of paths at the platform or virtual file system level.
     * For example, an operating system may not allow specific characters to be
     * present in a file name, but a specific underlying file store may impose
     * different or additional restrictions on the set of legal
     * characters.
     *
     * <p> This method throws {@link InvalidPathException} when the path string
     * cannot be converted to a path. Where possible, and where applicable,
     * the exception is created with an {@link InvalidPathException#getIndex
     * index} value indicating the first position in the {@code path} parameter
     * that caused the path string to be rejected.

     * <p>
     * The {@code syntaxAndPattern} parameter identifies the syntax and the

     * <blockquote><pre>
     * <i>syntax</i><b>:</b><i>pattern</i>
     * </pre></blockquote>
     * where {@code ':'} stands for itself.
     *
     * <p> A {@code FileSystem} implementation supports the "{@code glob}" and
     * "{@code regex}" syntax's. The value of the syntax
     * component is compared without regard to case.
     *
     * <p> When the syntax is "{@code glob}" then the {@code String}
     * representation of the path is matched using a limited pattern language
     * that resembles regular expressions but with a simpler syntax.
     *
     * <p> The following rules are used to interpret glob patterns:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li><p> The {@code *} character matches zero or more {@link Character
     *   characters} of a {@link Path#getName(int) name} component without
     *   crossing directory boundaries. </p></li>
     *
     *   <li><p> The {@code **} characters matches zero or more {@link Character
     *   characters} crossing directory boundaries. </p></li>
     *
     *   <li><p> The {@code ?} character matches exactly one character of a
     *   name component.</p></li>
     *
     *   <li><p> The backslash character ({@code \}) is used to escape characters
     *   that would otherwise be interpreted as special characters. The expression
     *   {@code \\} matches a single backslash and "\{" matches a left brace
     *   for example.  </p></li>
     *
     *   <li><p> The {@code [ ]} characters are a <i>bracket expression</i> that
     *   match a single character of a name component out of a set of characters.
     *   For example, {@code [abc]} matches {@code "a"}, {@code "b"}, or {@code "c"}.
     *   The hyphen ({@code -}) may be used to specify a range so {@code [a-z]}
     *   specifies a range that matches from {@code "a"} to {@code "z"} (inclusive).
     *   These forms can be mixed so [abce-g] matches {@code "a"}, {@code "b"},
     *   {@code "c"}, {@code "e"}, {@code "f"} or {@code "g"}. If the character
     *   after the {@code [} is a {@code !} then it is used for negation so {@code
     *   [!a-c]} matches any character except {@code "a"}, {@code "b"}, or {@code
     *   "c"}.
     *   <p> Within a bracket expression the {@code *}, {@code ?} and {@code \}
     *   characters match themselves. The ({@code -}) character matches itself if
     *   it is the first character within the brackets, or the first character
     *   after the {@code !} if negating.</p></li>
     *
     *   <li><p> The {@code { }} characters are a group of sub-patterns, where
     *   the group matches if any subpattern in the group matches. The {@code ","}
     *   character is used to separate the sub-patterns. Groups cannot be nested.
     *   </p></li>
     *
     *   <li><p> Leading period dot characters in file name are
     *   treated as regular characters in match operations. For example,
     *   the {@code "*"} glob pattern matches file name {@code ".login"}.
     *   The {@link Files#isHidden} method may be used to test whether a file
     *   is considered hidden.
     *   </p></li>
     *
     *   <li><p> All other characters match themselves in an implementation
     *   dependent manner. This includes characters representing any {@link
     *   FileSystem#getSeparator name-separators}. </p></li>
     *
     *   <li><p> The matching of {@link Path#getRoot root} components is highly
     *   implementation-dependent and is not specified. </p></li>
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p> When the syntax is "{@code regex}" then the pattern component is a
     * regular expression as defined by the {@link Pattern}
     * class.
     *
     * <p>  For both the glob and regex syntaxes, the matching details, such as
     * whether the matching is case-sensitive, are implementation-dependent
     * and therefore not specified.
